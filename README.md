## Requirements

This project requires those dependencies to be installed in order to function properly:

- [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)
- [Rivatuner Statistics Server](https://www.guru3d.com/files-details/rtss-rivatuner-statistics-server-download.html)
- [ViGEmBus](https://github.com/ViGEm/ViGEmBus/releases)

It is strongly advised that following software is uninstalled or disabled:

- [SWICD](https://github.com/mKenfenheuer/steam-deck-windows-usermode-driver)
- [GlosSI](https://github.com/Alia5/GlosSI)
- [HidHide](https://github.com/ViGEm/HidHide)

## Anti-Cheat and Antivirus software

Since this project uses direct manipulation of kernel memory via `inpoutx64.dll`
it might trigger Antivirus and Anti-Cheat software.

If you use at least version `0.5.x` you can disable kernel drivers usage that should
avoid trippping Anti-Cheat detection. Set FAN to `Default` and disable `OSD Kernel Drivers`.
Of course you will miss some metrics due to that.
