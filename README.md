## Additional informations

- [Controller Shortcuts](docs/shortcuts.md) - default shortcuts when using [Steam Controller](docs/steam-controller.md).
- [Development](docs/development.md) - how to compile this project.
- [Risks](docs/risks.md) - this project uses kernel manipulation and might result in unstable system.
- The latest development version can be found in [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ayufan/steam-deck-tools/releases).
- The variant with `SteamDeckTools-<version>-debug.zip` enables all experimental features enabled, but might be unstable and buggy.

## Anti-Cheat and Antivirus software

Since this project uses direct manipulation of kernel memory via `inpoutx64.dll`
it might trigger Antivirus and Anti-Cheat software.

If you use at least version `0.5.x` you can disable kernel drivers usage that should
avoid trippping Anti-Cheat detection. Set FAN to `Default` and disable `OSD Kernel Drivers`.
Of course you will miss some metrics due to that.
